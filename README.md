Proviz School of AI Landing Page
Overview
This project is a full-stack landing page for Proviz School of AI, designed to attract prospective students. The page provides an introduction to the school, its mission, and includes a form for students to apply to the school. The landing page is built using client-side rendering with EJS as the templating engine on the backend, powered by Node.js.

Clean and Futuristic Design: A visually appealing UI with a professional layout that aligns with the AI education theme.
Application Form: A form that collects user information (name, phone number, email, and brief statement) for prospective applicants.
Form Submission: The form data is processed securely and stored in a backend database (e.g., MongoDB).
SEO Optimized: Basic SEO practices are applied, including metadata, descriptive headings, and alt text for images.
No Admin Panel: While an admin panel could be added for managing submissions, this feature has not been implemented.
Technologies Used
